        <h3 class="bio-title">My career so far</h3>
        <p class="bio-texty">I graduated from the Department of English at the University of Ibadan. Upon graduation, I knew I wanted more so I took a course on Data-driven decision making and so I was able to land my first job in tech but not as a techie, however being in that space did me a lot of good as I was able to see the opportunities that abound in the space. This has lead me into kick-starting my career in software engineering</p>
